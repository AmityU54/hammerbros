## Basic info on Armouring
### Intro
Armouring is a mastery of metalwork, and often considered one of the hardest practices to pursue in metalworking. It requires a lot of practice, as well as a significant amount of study. Anyone can be a good armourer, and anyone can be a great armourer; it does, however, require a large amount of dedication and focus on learning.\
\
To learn armouring, it is heavily recommended to not only practice making the pieces, but to study extants and use other sources to learn as well. There are some notable literature pieces, as well as at least one youtube channel that can be great resources for learning- all of which will be found in the resources tab of the guide.

### Terminology
The page is written under the assumption that the reader is familiar with all of the terminology. This terminology will be listed here, both for education, and for ease of access. In no particular order:
* Maille- What "Chainmail" is actually called. Chainmail is a modern misnomer.
* Planishing- Striking the surface of plates on a flat and polished object, as to smooth out divots and hammer marks in the piece.
* Extant- A surviving historical piece. If a piece of armour in a museum was created during the Renaissance, then it is an armour extant.
* Dishing- Striking a piece into a "divot" or depression, in order to form curves.
* Raising- Doing the same thing in reverse, striking a piece over something smaller than it (usually a trailer hitch or ball stake.) This can also curve the piece, to a lesser extent.
* Fluting- Small depressions on armour pieces for a decorative (and very mildly functional) effect.
