If you've made it this far, then you should be ready to make your first piece of armour. The starting project for a beginning armourer is a spaulder, the precursor to a pauldron. This section will walk you through that project. Please note that these instructions are for making the armour out of mild steel, and thus do not mention anything related to heating, annealing, work-hardening, etc.

# Forming the plates
First, you want to download the patterns for the spaulders from the pattern archive, and then print them out. Cut the pieces out of the paper and use them to trace the pattern onto your sheet metal.

Once you do this, you need to cut them out of the sheet metal, using: cutoff disk on an angle grinder; bandsaw; beverly shears; or you can file them out with a round file or jeweler's saw. Then, you will want to 
finish the edges up and make them smoother, using either sandpaper or a belt sander to get rid of the sharp edges and leftover material.

After this, you want to begin forming them on your dishing stump or dishing forms, hammering the pieces into the dishes in order to create the curvature. I usually start with the shoulder cop- the curve should be
quite dramatic. Keep hammering with the round side of a ball peen hammer until you've reached roughly your desired shape.
