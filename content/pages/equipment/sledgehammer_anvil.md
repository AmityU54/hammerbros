One of the most [frequently asked questions](/pages/getting_started/faq) we get from beginners is, "what can I use for an anvil?" One often overlooked but widely accessible and affordable option is the humble sledgehammer head. We recommend looking for one that weighs at least 10 lbs (4.5kg).

Community member @AkersRidgeForge got this 16lb sledgehammer head for $4 (USD) at a yard sale:

He traced the head onto the stump, then used a paddle bit to drill out inside the traced circle, The sledgehammer is anchored to the log with flat bar stock fitted through the eye and affixed to the stump with lag bolts.
